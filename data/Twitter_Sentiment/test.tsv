negative	@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
negative	@AmericanAir if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah.
negative	@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
neutral	@AmericanAir Why is your cover photo of TWA? Just wondering.
positive	@JetBlue Even though this flight #226 didn't have much needed hot beverages 4 us NY-ers, the landing was super smooth 👍👍 😊 #happytweet

negative	@AmericanAir Understood. Integration takes time, but no excuse for poor customer service
positive	@SouthwestAir @ PIT- Gate A1! Big shout out to the lady trying to track him down!
negative	@USAirways yes. But the manner with which it was done was harsh for those affected. Already checked in. No remorse. Weak alternatives.

negative	@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
negative	@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.

negative	@AmericanAir I'm beyond confused here. why would you offer an earlier flight?? when they Cancelled Flightled 2222, I asked for TUES. please fix!
negative	@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs

neutral	@AmericanAir hi how are you
negative	@united On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I'm Late Flight now?
negative	@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
negative	@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
negative	@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :(

positive	@VirginAmerica that doesn't look to fat to me! It looks yummy!
neutral	@united traveling from FRA thru IAD to MCO tomorrow, concerned abt IAD weather. Can't change until advisory issued? Any advice?
negative	@USAirways The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up.

negative	@JetBlue What's up with lack coffee on 7:30AM flight. Was told someone forgot to load coffee onto the plane. What????? #INeedCoffee
negative	@united i sure will
neutral	@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags

neutral	@AmericanAir  hung up on now many times trying to cal 8004337300 crazy
negative	@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.
negative	@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
positive	@SouthwestAir yes please!
positive	@SouthwestAir Awesome!!! Sending now.

negative	@united help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded?

negative	"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
negative	@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
negative	@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
negative	@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
