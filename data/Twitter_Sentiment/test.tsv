negative	@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
negative	@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.

negative	@united On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I'm Late Flight now?
negative	@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
negative	@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
negative	@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :(

negative	@united i sure will

neutral	@AmericanAir  hung up on now many times trying to cal 8004337300 crazy
negative	@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.

positive	@SouthwestAir yes please!
positive	@SouthwestAir Awesome!!! Sending now.

negative	"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
negative	@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
negative	@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
negative	@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
